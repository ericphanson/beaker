# Bulk/Directory Mode Implementation Log

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Branch:** claude/subagent-driven-development-011CUWRVwX4W8JF24hfj4Tfc
**Plan:** docs/plans/2025-10-26-bulk-directory-mode.md

## Progress Summary

Using subagent-driven development to implement the bulk/directory mode feature for beaker-gui.

---

## Task 1: Create DirectoryView Data Structures ✅

**Status:** COMPLETED
**Commit:** b9ed139d2a3ece350302325a77bce6c224a5584f
**Pushed:** Yes

### Implementation
- Created `beaker-gui/src/views/directory.rs` with core data structures:
  - `ProcessingStatus` enum (Waiting, Processing, Success, Error)
  - `ImageState` struct for per-image tracking
  - `DirectoryView` struct with image list and processing state
  - `DetectionRef` for aggregate detection references
- Added re-exports in `beaker/src/lib.rs` for `ProcessingEvent` and `ProcessingStage`

### Tests
- Added `test_directory_view_creation` - PASSED
- Followed TDD: test failed first (compilation error), then passed after implementation

### Notes
- Had to re-export ProcessingEvent from beaker lib for GUI access

---

## Task 2: Register DirectoryView in Module System ✅

**Status:** COMPLETED
**Commit:** 3764c3164ebf04233180e03417ccebf530432bd4
**Pushed:** Yes

### Implementation
- Modified `beaker-gui/src/views/mod.rs`:
  - Added `mod directory;` declaration
  - Added public exports: `DirectoryView`, `ProcessingStatus`, `ImageState`

### Tests
- Added `test_directory_view_module_accessible` - PASSED
- All 179 tests in suite passed

### Notes
- Clean implementation, no issues

---

## Task 3: Add DirectoryView to AppState ✅

**Status:** COMPLETED
**Commit:** 9663c97
**Pushed:** Yes

### Implementation
- Modified `beaker-gui/src/app.rs`:
  - Added `Directory(DirectoryView)` variant to AppState enum
  - Added match arm in update() to call `directory_view.show(ctx, ui)`

### Tests
- Added `test_app_state_supports_directory_view` - PASSED
- All 179 tests passed

### Notes
- Followed TDD approach exactly as specified

---

## Task 4: Wire DirectoryView into App Update Loop ✅

**Status:** COMPLETED
**Commit:** 5d3a4fc50b00202f4c3478566428a9366ca99b25
**Pushed:** Yes

### Implementation
- Modified `beaker-gui/src/app.rs`:
  - Added test coverage for DirectoryView in update loop
  - Match arm was already present from Task 3 (as anticipated by plan)

### Tests
- Added `test_app_renders_directory_view` - PASSED
- Verified TDD by temporarily removing match arm, seeing it fail, then restoring

### Notes
- Implementation was already complete from Task 3, added test coverage

---

## Task 5: Implement Folder Opening Logic ✅

**Status:** COMPLETED
**Commit:** 4f1bf785c8001c015a52d4c70f5cd63c0699ea4d
**Pushed:** Pending

### Implementation
- Modified `beaker-gui/src/app.rs`:
  - Implemented `open_folder()` method to create DirectoryView
  - Added `collect_image_files()` helper to find .jpg/.jpeg/.png files
  - Transitions to Directory state when folder opened
  - Adds folder to recent files

### Tests
- Added `test_open_folder_creates_directory_view` - PASSED
- All 14 GUI tests passed

### Notes
- Had to free up disk space with `cargo clean` before running tests
- Found that `just test` only runs beaker lib tests, not GUI tests
- Need to use `cd beaker-gui && cargo test --lib` for GUI tests

---

## Task 6: Start Background Processing Thread ✅

**Status:** COMPLETED
**Commit:** 91993662e259e3f1a0072bbea8ed04c1974773ef
**Pushed:** Pending

### Implementation
- Modified `beaker-gui/src/views/directory.rs`:
  - Added `start_processing()` method that spawns background thread
  - Creates MPSC channel for progress events
  - Background thread runs `beaker::detection::run_detection_with_options()`
  - Passes progress callback and cancel flag to detection
  - Creates temp output directory for results

### Tests
- Added `test_start_processing_creates_thread` - PASSED
- All 179 tests passed

### Notes
- Initially used wrong function name (`run_detection` vs `run_detection_with_options`)
- Corrected to use the version that accepts progress channel and cancel flag

## Issues Encountered

1. **ONNX model download failures** - Known issue, documented in CLAUDE.md
2. **Disk space** - Needed to run `cargo clean` to free up space
3. **Test execution** - `just test` only runs beaker lib tests, not GUI tests

## Overall Status

**Tasks Completed:** 5/21
**Progress:** 24%
**Status:** On track, following TDD approach successfully
