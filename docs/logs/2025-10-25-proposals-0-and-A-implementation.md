# Implementation Log: Proposal 0 & Proposal A

**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Task:** Implement Proposal 0 (File Navigation & Opening) and Proposal A (Bulk/Directory Mode Foundation)

## Progress

### Session Start
- Read detection features plan
- Analyzed current codebase structure
- Created implementation todo list

## Todo List

Will be managed via TodoWrite tool.

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Library Changes for Progress Reporting (Completed)
- ✅ Added dependencies to beaker-gui/Cargo.toml (rfd, serde_json, dirs)
- ✅ Added ProcessingEvent enum with variants:
  - ImageStart: Emitted when starting to process an image
  - ImageComplete: Emitted when image processing completes (success or error)
  - StageChange: Emitted when transitioning between quality and detection stages
  - Progress: For overall progress updates
- ✅ Added ProcessingStage enum (Quality, Detection)
- ✅ Added ProcessingResult enum (Success, Error)
- ✅ Modified run_model_processing_with_quality_outputs to accept:
  - progress_tx: Option<Sender<ProcessingEvent>>
  - cancel_flag: Option<Arc<AtomicBool>>
- ✅ Modified processing loop to:
  - Check for cancellation at start of each iteration
  - Emit ImageStart events
  - Emit ImageComplete events (both success and error)
- ✅ Created run_detection_with_progress function that:
  - Accepts progress_tx and cancel_flag parameters
  - Emits StageChange events for quality and detection stages
  - Passes progress parameters through to processing functions
- ✅ Exported new types from beaker lib for GUI use
- ✅ All existing tests pass (61 tests)

### Phase 2: Proposal 0 - File Navigation & Opening (Completed)
- ✅ Created WelcomeView struct with:
  - Native file dialogs using rfd crate (Open Image, Open Folder)
  - Drag & drop support for files and folders
  - Recent files list (persisted to JSON)
  - Clean, centered UI with drop zone
  - Error display for failed operations
- ✅ Updated BeakerApp to use AppState enum (Welcome, Detection)
- ✅ Implemented action handling for opening files/folders
- ✅ Added menu items for File > Open Image/Folder
- ✅ Added dependencies: chrono, rfd, dirs, serde_json
- ✅ Fixed deprecated API usage (allocate_ui_at_rect → new_child)
- ✅ GUI builds successfully in release mode
- ✅ Added unit tests for ProcessingEvent types (3 tests pass)

**Features working:**
- Launch app → See welcome screen
- Click "Open Image" → Native file dialog → Opens image in DetectionView
- Click "Open Folder" → Shows "not yet implemented" (will be Proposal A)
- Drag & drop image → Opens in DetectionView
- Recent files persisted to ~/.config/beaker-gui/recent.json
- File > Open Image/Folder menu items

## Issues Encountered

None so far. All tests passing (64 tests total: 61 lib + 3 new).

## Next Steps

Starting with dependencies and library changes first.
