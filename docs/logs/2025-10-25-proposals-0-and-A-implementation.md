# Implementation Log: Proposal 0 & Proposal A

**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Task:** Implement Proposal 0 (File Navigation & Opening) and Proposal A (Bulk/Directory Mode Foundation)

## Progress

### Session Start
- Read detection features plan
- Analyzed current codebase structure
- Created implementation todo list

## Todo List

Will be managed via TodoWrite tool.

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Library Changes for Progress Reporting (Completed)
- ✅ Added dependencies to beaker-gui/Cargo.toml (rfd, serde_json, dirs)
- ✅ Added ProcessingEvent enum with variants:
  - ImageStart: Emitted when starting to process an image
  - ImageComplete: Emitted when image processing completes (success or error)
  - StageChange: Emitted when transitioning between quality and detection stages
  - Progress: For overall progress updates
- ✅ Added ProcessingStage enum (Quality, Detection)
- ✅ Added ProcessingResult enum (Success, Error)
- ✅ Modified run_model_processing_with_quality_outputs to accept:
  - progress_tx: Option<Sender<ProcessingEvent>>
  - cancel_flag: Option<Arc<AtomicBool>>
- ✅ Modified processing loop to:
  - Check for cancellation at start of each iteration
  - Emit ImageStart events
  - Emit ImageComplete events (both success and error)
- ✅ Created run_detection_with_progress function that:
  - Accepts progress_tx and cancel_flag parameters
  - Emits StageChange events for quality and detection stages
  - Passes progress parameters through to processing functions
- ✅ Exported new types from beaker lib for GUI use
- ✅ All existing tests pass (61 tests)

## Issues Encountered

(Any issues will be documented here)

## Next Steps

Starting with dependencies and library changes first.
